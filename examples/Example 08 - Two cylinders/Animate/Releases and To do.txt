New in 1.10:

The Script command. If it is convenient to split a script in two, the
other half can be in another worksheet. It is up to the user to choose
wether a Table or a Script is more convenient.


New in 1.20:

One global list of scripts, so if several assemblies refer to the same 
script, the image generated by that script is only calculated once for 
each screen. This saves computing time and memory.

The Frames class is removed. Settings for each frame are calculated at 
the time the frame is created.

A superclass where all the generic properties and methods of Items are
stored, Image, Text, Assembly, etc. are subclasses of the BaseItem. This 
makes the code much more compact.

New in 1.21:

Image quality for scaling of images improved with the use of 
Image.ANTIALIAS

New in 1.23:

Includes the CANVAS item which is based on the ASSEMBLY item but is not
erased between frames.

Release 1.24:
Small bug fixes

===================================

To do:

Allow for negative scaling

Solve why opacity turns to red


Create example with CANVAS

Make Animate run with SVG elements instead of PNGs

Let the user choose between 'fast' or 'pretty'

Gather all scaling, translation and rotation transformations in one

Make a robust Init procedure for the font directory. Use try .. except
statements to check in which folder the fonts are located and which 
fonts are available.

Zorder as DiscreteProperty

Zorder, while time[index] < time

Remember images in different phases, create the possibility to turn it 
off if too memory intensive
	
Some commands, like FRAMESPERSECOND, are sorted by row rather than by 
time. This may be confusing in some situations. Make all commands time 
dependent

Parse commands can be easier if commands are grouped in a few groups

Opacity interpolates only linear. Benificial to add other options?
