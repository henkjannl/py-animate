# Example 9: Canvas

<img src="canvas_demo.gif" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

The following stack is used for this example:

![Canvas example stack](Design/canvas_stack.png)

The canvas constains 20 dots; 5 of each color. Every frame, the dots are drawn on the canvas at a different location.

The hierarchy looks like this:

In the `TABLE`, `XPOS`, `YPOS`, `XSCALE` and `YSCALE` of each dot are controlled. These are all just random values.
